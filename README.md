A simple end-to-end encrypted chat application using Pythonâ€™s cryptography library (Fernet) to secure client-server communication via AES-128-CBC encryption, mitigating risks of eavesdropping and MITM attacks. 

It uses a multi-threaded TCP/IP server to handle concurrent client connections securely, with server-generated cryptographic keys for session-specific encryption. 

There is also integrated socket programming and threading to maintain low-latency communication while preserving data integrity and  confidentiality.
